==============

Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~

PyTIS is work in progress. It works well for the features that are implemented,
but at the time of writing, only a few things are implemented. The idea is to
gradually extend PyTIS that it can be used for transition interface sampling, or
other extended ensemble methods.
